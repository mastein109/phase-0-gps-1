##What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Previous to the GPS session, I was a little confused on the proper order of the steps to take when pushing and pulling repos between local and remote branches. After some practice on my own and within the GPS, I feel a lot more comfortable with the process!

##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The concepts that we focused on were pushing and pulling repos to/from each of our local branches to/from our remote repository. It was really cool experimenting with another person utilizing the remote repository.

##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked my guide about having the driver's username as the link to the repo and if we had to have our own username for our local repo. He cleared up that because the navigator is a contributor, the repo will remain under the driver's username.

My pair and I didn't necessarily ask questions, but rather discussed the different topics involving git and added to each other's responses, in order to expand our knowledge of what we have learned on our own.

##What still confuses you about git?
For now, I have a pretty good understanding about git and what we have learned thus far. However, I do not doubt that I will run into at least a little bit of confusion at some point or another in future git endeavors!

##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
At first, I was a little nervous because my partner's mic did not work. However, we both contributed to making it work out regardless of our diability as a whole. I really enjoyed the GPS and working as a team to get through all of the releases together. In addition, we found it best to switch between driving and navigating, so we were able to fully experience both sides of our GPS!
