#What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was still trying to familiarize myself with all of the commands that git had to offer.  I am becoming more comfortable navigating around, and can use most of the basic commands now.

#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The concepts that were clarified were how sharing a repository in git was managed, how a pull request was the best practice, and how the present working directory affected git.

#What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Bison gave pretty much straight forward pointers, and we did not really have to ask him much.  I learned a lot from Mollie about how the Mac interface works and great shortcuts to use (since I am new to Mac).

#What still confuses you about git?
I am still confused on whether it is best practice for me to make a new branch in git every time I need to make a small correction or whether I should be working on the same branch until it is 100% of where I want it to be at.

#How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was great, Mollie was a fantastic partner and we overcame some technical difficulties in order to conquer the challenge.
